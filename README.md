# JavaScript-Quiz

## Description
This is a quiz pertaining to JavaScipt in which the user has a group of questions they answer and receive 5 points for a correct answer and a 5 point penality for an incorrect answer. At the end of the quiz, the user may input their name to be recorded in a list of scores. The purpose of this build was a better understanding of JavaScript while utilizing Web APIs. I encountered many learning opportunies in coding the functions for each phase of the game. The idea behind the build was to have each phase of the game be a screen set up in HTML and then manipulated via JavaScript. I also worked to learn more about utilizing local storage and providing data back to the user from it. I would like to spend more time in the future to update the look of the game as well as the high scores screen be sorted high to low.
